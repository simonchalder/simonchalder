- 👋 Hi, I’m @simonchalder

- 👀 I’m interested in coding of all kinds!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning OOP principles and how to use them effectively in applications. 
Currently I am working with Python and C# .NET on desktop / console applications and I am studying GUI packages such as Tkinter Qt and WPF.
In time I intend to integrate more database and API usage into my projects. I have some web development experience and I am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.

Recent projects I have worked on:

- A stock management system in C# .NET with a remote MongoDB database
- A bill and tip calculator in .NET C# with WPF
- An application to practice unit testing in .NET C#
- An image conversion and resizing application - Written in Python with a Tkinter GUI and using the Pillow (PIL) library
- An application to retrieve vinyl record data from the Discogs.com API - Written in Python with a Tkinter GUI
- A record cataloguing application for vinyl records - Written in C# with a WPF GUI. Currently records data to a CSV file

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps me learn!
