- 👋 Hi, I’m @simonchalder

- 👀 I’m interested in coding of all kinds!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning OOP principles and how to use them effectively in applications. 
Currently I am working with Python and C# on desktop applications mainly console based but I am studying GUI packages such as Tkinter and WPF.
In time I intend to integrate more database and API usage into my projects.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps me learn!

- 📫 How to reach me ... You can reach me on Github (obviously), Twitter @ChalderSimon and on Mastodon @cybersi_io@fosstodon.org
